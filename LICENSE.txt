THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") IS BETWEEN YOU ("YOU") AND THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDER IDENTIFIED ABOVE ("DEVELOPER"). BY INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR
USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS
1.0 "You" means the individual or legal entity that installs, copies, accesses,
    uses, modifies, or distributes the Software, and includes any person acting
    on that individual's or entity's behalf.
1.1 "Software" means the software made available by Developer at:
    https://github.com/def9a2a4/BlockShips
    including without limitation all source code, binaries, assets, build files,
    documentation, configuration files, examples, and any updates, patches, or
    modifications made available by Developer at that location.
1.2 "Modify" means to alter, adapt, translate, refactor, optimize, patch, or
    create derivative works of the Software, in whole or in part.
1.3 "Server" means any instance, deployment, or service that hosts, emulates, or
    provides a Minecraft multiplayer server environment on which the Software is
    installed, loaded, executed, accessed, or used to provide functionality to
    players, including without limitation any server software derived from, based
    on, compatible with, or implementing the network protocol or functionality of
    the original Minecraft server software distributed by Mojang Studios and/or
    Microsoft (including any version thereof), and any forks, derivatives, or
    compatible implementations, whether known or later developed, including
    without limitation Paper, Spigot, Bukkit, Purpur, Fabric, Forge, NeoForge,
    Sponge, Velocity, BungeeCord, Waterfall, and any similar proxy, wrapper, or
    compatibility layer, together with any related infrastructure that directly
    supports gameplay access (including proxies and backend nodes).
1.4 "Commercial Server" means any Server (or the operation of any Server) for
    which any person or entity receives, seeks to receive, or reasonably expects
    to receive any money, revenue, financial benefit, consideration, or other
    material advantage that is directly or indirectly connected to the Server,
    its access, its community, its operation, or the gameplay experience.
    Without limiting the foregoing, a Server is a Commercial Server if any of
    the following apply, whether now or at any time during the period of use of
    the Software:
    (a) Access is sold, licensed, paid for, or otherwise gated by payment or
        consideration (including queues, whitelisting, or events);
    (b) The operator solicits or receives donations, tips, subscriptions,
        patronage, or "support" for the Server or its costs, regardless of
        whether perks are provided;
    (c) The operator sells or offers in-game items, ranks, cosmetics, perks, or
        any gameplay-related benefit, including "donation perks" or preferential
        treatment;
    (d) The Server or its community is sponsored, advertised, promoted for pay,
        or otherwise monetized (including ads, sponsors, affiliate links, or
        paid partnerships) in a way connected to the Server;
    (e) The Server is operated by, for, or in connection with a business,
        brand, organization, or revenue-generating project (including where the
        Server functions as marketing, community-building, lead generation, or
        brand engagement);
    (f) The Software is used to provide services to third parties for a fee,
        including hosting, managed services, resale, bundling, consulting, or
        operation on behalf of another party;
    (g) Any officer, owner, staff member, contractor, or operator is paid or
        otherwise compensated in connection with the Server's operation;
    (h) The Server is connected to, participates in, or interoperates with any
        multi-server network, cluster, proxy network, hub-and-spoke system, or
        similar arrangement (including cross-server travel, shared accounts,
        shared economies, shared permissions, shared chat, shared authentication,
        shared player data, or any other shared service), where any server in the
        network is itself a Commercial Server, or where the network as a whole
        provides, supports, enables, or facilitates any Commercial Server
        characteristics described in this Section 1.4.
    For avoidance of doubt: "Commercial Server" includes servers that claim to
    be "non-profit", "at-cost", "donation-only", or "community-funded" if any
    funds or value are solicited or received in connection with the Server.
1.5 "Commercial License" means a separate written license agreement granted by
    Developer (or expressly agreed in writing by Developer) authorizing use of
    the Software on a Commercial Server.

    access controls, network arrangements, or other mechanisms in a manner

    to the Server will be treated as Commercial Server use.
